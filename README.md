This was really useful, I managed to get the basic layout using flex but would have liked to use more semantic html. I ended up using a load of divs with classes as it was easier to use flexbox that way (which was the point of the exercise anyway!) 

Tried to override defaults for h1 tag but couldn't. Will look into this. Running in Chrome.

I tried to put some images into the media boxes but couldn't get them to fit inside the containers. Will look into this more anon.

Now to look at some of the other solutions!!
